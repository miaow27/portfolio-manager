Current Earning: _Gains from selling the stock - Spend from buying the stock_
- Definination: from your bank account point, how much you have gained/loss currently? 
- if you still hold a large amoun of shares, this number can be negative 
- Pros: 
  - when this number of negative, it shows how much value your remaining shares need to have to break even 
  - when this number is positive: it shows you already making money 
  - this also shows how much "cash" you have in each stock (negative)

Total Earning: _Current Earning + Values of holding shares (at today's price)_
- Defintion: your revenue (including the value of your stocks)
- this has a big "IF" on two thing (1) market price today (2) if you sell them right now 
- Pros: this shows the total "values" you gains from investing in your stock
